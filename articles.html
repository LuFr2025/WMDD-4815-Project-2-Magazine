        Astrobiology (also xenology or exobiology) is a scientific field within the life and environmental 
        sciences that studies the origins, early evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe 
        by investigating its deterministic conditions and contingent events.As a discipline, astrobiology is
        founded on the premise that life may exist beyond Earth.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      Research in astrobiology comprises three main areas: the study of habitable environments in the Solar 
      System and beyond, the search for planetary biosignatures of past or present extraterrestrial life, and 
      the study of the origin and early evolution of life on Earth.The field of astrobiology has its origins 
      in the 20th century with the advent of space exploration and the discovery of exoplanets. 
      Early astrobiology research focused on the search for extraterrestrial life and the study of the potential
      for life to exist on other planets. In the 1960s and 1970s, NASA began its astrobiology pursuits within 
      the Viking program, which was the first US mission to land on Mars and search for signs of life.
      This mission, along with other early space exploration missions, laid the foundation for the development 
      of astrobiology as a discipline.
      <br>
      <br>
      Regarding habitable environments, astrobiology investigates potential locations beyond Earth that could support life,
      such as Mars, Europa, and exoplanets, through research into the extremophiles populating austere environments on Earth,
      like volcanic and deep sea environments. Research within this topic is conducted utilising the methodology of the 
      geosciences, especially geobiology, for astrobiological applications.
      <br>
      <br>
      The search for biosignatures involves the identification of signs of past or present life in the form of organic 
      compounds, isotopic ratios, or microbial fossils. Research within this topic is conducted utilising the methodology 
      of planetary and environmental science, especially atmospheric science, for astrobiological applications, and is 
      often conducted through remote sensing and in situ missions.
      <br>
      <br>
      Astrobiology also concerns the study of the origin and early evolution of life on Earth to try to understand the 
      conditions that are necessary for life to form on other planets.This research seeks to understand how life emerged 
      from non-living matter and how it evolved to become the diverse array of organisms we see today. Research within this 
      topic is conducted utilising the methodology of paleosciences, especially paleobiology, for astrobiological applications.

      Astrobiology is a rapidly developing field with a strong interdisciplinary aspect that holds many challenges and 
      opportunities for scientists. Astrobiology programs and research centres are present in many universities and research 
      institutions around the world, and space agencies like NASA and ESA have dedicated departments and programs for 
      astrobiology research.
      <br>
      <br>
      The modern field of astrobiology can be traced back to the 1950s and 1960s with the advent of space exploration, when 
      scientists began to seriously consider the possibility of life on other planets. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, 
      the first artificial satellite, which marked the beginning of the Space Age. 
      This event led to an increase in the study of the potential for life on other planets, as scientists began to consider the possibilities
      opened up by the new technology of space exploration. In 1959, NASA funded its first exobiology project, and in 1960, NASA founded the
      Exobiology Program, now one of four main elements of NASA's current Astrobiology Program. In 1971, NASA funded Project Cyclops, part of 
      the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, to search radio frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum for interstellar communications 
      transmitted by extraterrestrial life outside the Solar System. In the 1960s-1970s, NASA established the Viking program, which was the first
      US mission to land on Mars and search for metabolic signs of present life; the results were inconclusive.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the 1980s and 1990s, the field began to expand and diversify as new discoveries and technologies emerged.
      The discovery of microbial life in extreme environments on Earth, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents, helped to clarify the 
      feasibility of potential life existing in harsh conditions. The development of new techniques for the detection of biosignatures, 
      such as the use of stable isotopes, also played a significant role in the evolution of the field.
      <br>
      <br>
      The contemporary landscape of astrobiology emerged in the early 21st century, focused on utilising Earth 
      and environmental science for applications within comparate space environments. Missions included the ESA's 
      Beagle 2, which failed minutes after landing on Mars, NASA's Phoenix lander, which probed the environment for 
      past and present planetary habitability of microbial life on Mars and researched the history of water, and 
      NASA's Curiosity rover, currently probing the environment for past and present planetary habitability of 
      microbial life on Mars.

      <h4>
        Studying terrestrial extremophiles
      </h4>
      <p>
        Astrobiological research concerning the study of habitable environments in our solar system and beyond utilises methods 
        within the geosciences. Research within this branch primarily concerns the geobiology of organisms that can survive in 
        extreme environments on Earth, such as in volcanic or deep sea environments, to understand the limits of life, and the 
        conditions under which life might be able to survive on other planets. This includes, but is not limited to:
      </p>
      <h4>
        Deep-sea extremophiles:
      </h4> 
      <p>
        Researchers are studying organisms that live in the extreme environments of deep-sea hydrothermal 
        vents and cold seeps.These organisms survive in the absence of sunlight, and some are able to survive in high temperatures 
        and pressures, and use chemical energy instead of sunlight to produce food.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Desert extremophiles: 
      </h4>
      <p>
        Researchers are studying organisms that can survive in extreme dry, high temperature conditions, 
        such as in deserts.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Microbes in extreme environments:
      </h4>
      <p>
        Researchers are investigating the diversity and activity of microorganisms in environments 
        such as deep mines, subsurface soil, cold glaciers and polar ice, and high-altitude environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of 2024, no evidence of extraterrestrial life has been identified. Examination of the Allan Hills 84001 meteorite,
        which was recovered in Antarctica in 1984 and originated from Mars, is thought by David McKay, as well as few other 
        scientists, to contain microfossils of extraterrestrial origin; this interpretation is controversial.
        <br>
        Yamato 000593, the second largest meteorite from Mars, was found on Earth in 2000. At a microscopic level, spheres 
        are found in the meteorite that are rich in carbon compared to surrounding areas that lack such spheres. 
        The carbon-rich spheres may have been formed by biotic activity according to some NASA scientists.
        <br>
        <br>
        On 5 March 2011, Richard B. Hoover, a scientist with the Marshall Space Flight Center, speculated on the finding
        of alleged microfossils similar to cyanobacteria in CI1 carbonaceous meteorites in the fringe Journal of Cosmology, 
        a story widely reported on by mainstream media. However, NASA formally distanced itself from Hoover's claim. According
        to American astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson: "At the moment, life on Earth is the only known life in the universe,
        but there are compelling arguments to suggest we are not alone."
